	title = {The Democratic Deficit of the European Union},
	volume = {1},
	abstract = {The {EU}, as the most developed international organization, provides a laboratory for observing the development of democratic structures outside its member-states. The democratic deficit debate thus has implications that reach beyond the {EU} and touch upon crucial issues of future developments within democratic theory. This review distinguishes between three different types of legitimacy, namely procedural, efficiency and social legitimacy, and authors are discussed according to which type of legitimacy that underlines their analysis of the democratic deficit. Most authors invoke one type of legitimacy as their basis, but a new strand is emerging that mixes different types of legitimacy when establishing normative criteria for the {EU}. It is concluded that, in order to further the debate, this new strand has potential to develop advanced normative models appropriate for democracy beyond the nation-state.},

	abstract = {Whether their analytic frameworks focus on the {EU}'s institutional form and practices or on its interactive construction, scholars have analyzed the {EU}'s democratic legitimacy mainly in terms of the trade-offs between the output effectiveness of {EU}'s policies outcomes for the people and the input participation by the people. Missing is theorization of the "throughput" efficiency, accountability, transparency, and openness to consultation with the people of the {EU}'s internal governance processes. The paper argues that adding this analytic category facilitates assessment of these legitimizing mechanisms' interdependencies as well as consideration of reforms that could turn this democratic trilemma into a "virtuous circle".

	shorttitle = {The organization of influence on the {EC}'s common agriculturalpolicy},
	abstract = {The common agricultural policy of the {EC} with its market regulations is decided at {EC} level by a multilevel system of government, in which the Commission and the parliamentary parties of the European Parliament play the supranational role and the national ministries of agriculture act as parts of the intergovernmental system of the Council of Ministers. National interest groups have thereby three major access routes to the {EC} system, ﬁrst through their national governments, or second indirectly, transmitted by their European peak organizations, or third directly to the supranational {EC} actors. The network approach is applied to study empirically the densities of access through these various routes. The links between actors in the agricultural policy domain are conceptualized as links for the exchange of resources, the most important resource of a policy domain being the ﬁnal control of policy decisions. The political actors of the governance system originally hold full control of this valuable resource which they exchange for inﬂuence resources possessed by the interest groups, as public support or expert knowledge. Empirically, answers to the network questions depend on the type of resource and the viewpoint of the interviewed actors. An index is developed which indicates the resource ﬂows between actors and the distribution of equilibrium control of policy decisions. It is shown that the national ministers of agriculture depend very much on the support and expertise of their national farmers’ lobby, whereas the Commission relies more on contacts within the political sector itself. Multilevel systems need a lot of political coordination, so that the political actors within such systems, especially at the supranational level, seem to deal ﬁrst of all with each other and not so much with the demand side of politics, compared to the national ministers of agriculture.},

	abstract = {The practice of lobbying in the interest of economic or social groups plays an important role in the policy making process of most economies. While no data is available at this stage to examine the success of lobbies in exerting influence on specific policy issues, we perform a first systematic multi-layer network analysis of a large lobby registry. Here we focus on the domains of finance and climate and we combine information on affiliation and client relations from the {EU} transparency register with information about shareholding and interlocking directorates of firms. We find that the network centrality of lobby organizations has no simple relation with their lobbying budget. Moreover, different layers of the multiplex network provide complementary information to characterize organizations’ potential influence. At the aggregate level, it appears that while the domains of finance and climate are separated on the layer of affiliation relations, they become intertwined when economic relations are considered. Because groups of interest differ not only in their budget and network centrality but also in terms of their internal cohesiveness, drawing a map of both connections across and within groups is a precondition to better understand the dynamics of influence on policy making and the forces at play.},
