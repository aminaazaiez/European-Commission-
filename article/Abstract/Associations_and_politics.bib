	abstract = {L'{URIOPSS} Languedoc-Roussillon présente une nouvelle étude de mars 2015 sur la diversité des modes de coopération entre associations du secteur sanitaire et social. Leur effets en termes de gouvernance sont particulièrement analysés. Le rapport a été rédigé par des économistes du {LEST} (Laboratoire d’Économie et de Sociologie du Travail), qui est une unité mixte de recherche du {CNRS} et de l’Université d’Aix-Marseille. L'objectif de cette étude est de mieux comprendre les dynamiques de coopération entre associations de solidarité sur les territoires, et de relever les conséquences de ces formes de rapprochement sur le secteur associatif. La méthodologie utilisée est essentiellement qualitative, basée sur des études de cas appronfondies. Dix expériences de coopérations - six en Languedoc-Roussillon et quatre en Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur - ont été analysées, 24 entretiens individuels approfondis ont été réalisés. Les thématiques retenues étaient, entre autres, l'origine et la genèse de la coopération, sa démarche, ses effets. Les résultats obtenus montrent une diversité des types et des trajectoires de coopération. Ils soulignent notamment que ces processus constituent des opportunités de revisiter le projet associatif et de renouveler son modèle de gouvernance.},

In this study we compare general and political discussion net works using full sociometric social network data from a probability sample of voluntary organizations—specifically, intact student activity groups from a large Midwest research university. We find that even within these "weak tie" voluntary associations, general discussion networks clearly constrain the characteristics of the political discussion networks. However, political discussion networks appear to be less dense and more likely to be broken up into disconnected components than the general discussion networks. But, general and political networks do not appear to differ in their structuring by perceptions of discussant knowledge. And, most interestingly, we find that on average neither general nor political discussion net works are characterized by political homogeneity.},

	abstract = {In the context of the French presidential elections held in 2017, we developed the “Politoscope”, an open platform for the analysis of political tweets, which was used to collect and analyse almost 60 million Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users who interacted with French political ﬁgures. In this paper, we focus on the information revealed by this data, in terms of the development of the political environment during the elections. Among the numerous types of interaction that can be used with Twitter, we focus on that of retweeting. We characterise the socio-semantic networks of the French political environment, and their development over a period of eleven months preceding the presidential election. We show that analysis of retweet graphs can allow accurate and automatic monitoring of the reconﬁgurations of a multipolar political environment, by characterising the diﬀerent political communities, their alliance strategies and their semantic particularities.},

	abstract = {Informal discussion plays a crucial role in democracyy yet much of its value depends on diversity. We describe two models of political discussion. The purposive model holds that people typically select discussants who are knowledgeable and politically similar to them. The incidental model suggests that people talk politics for mostly idiosyncratic reasons , as by-products of nonpolitical social processes. To adjudicate between these accounts , we draw on a unique , multisitey panel data set of whole networks , with information about many social relationships , attitudes y and demographics. This evidence permits a stronger foundation for inferences than more common egocentric methods. We find that incidental processes shape discussion networks much more powerfully than purposive ones. Respondents tended to report discussants with whom they share other relationships and characteristics , rather than based on expertise or political similarity ; suggesting that stimulating discussion outside of echo chambers may be easier than previously thought.},

Are legislators affected by lobbyists? Is the capacity of social movements to mobilize affected by the structure of societal networks? Powerful evidence in the literature answers each of these questions in the affirmative. However, compared to other paradigmatic foci, political science has invested tiny amounts of capacity in the study of the relevance of networks to political phenomena. Far more attention has been paid to the psychology of how people process information individually as opposed to collectively, and to the role that institutions play in structuring politics as opposed to the relational undergirdings of politics. A review of the flagship journals in political science reveals a dearth of articles on networks. Few, if any, doctoral programs include courses for which the primary focus is network-related ideas, and even the notion of a relational dependence in data is rarely mentioned in discussions of the assumptions embedded in the statistical methods that dominate political science.},

Drawing on generic processes of persuasion and selection, this study specifies six testable research hypotheses about individuals' attitudes and behaviors as consequences of the form and content of their ego-centric networks. Using the network measures from the 1987 General Social Survey, respondents' perceptions of their ego-centric networks are found to predict involvement in national elections. The more frequently people discuss political matters with their intimates, the greater their interest and participation in national campaigns and voting. The partisan composition of the network strongly influences their participation, even after controlling for party identifications and selection effects of social attributes. However, respondents' closeness to network others has few substantial effects, and most of the interaction terms are not significant. For members of voluntary associations, having at least one other with whom they frequently discuss politics strongly boosts mobilization in internal organizational affairs and in the local community, again controlling for social attributes.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the study of political participation has beneﬁted from growing attention to the study of social networks. Historically, most explanations for political participation have focused on characteristics of individuals. Although these individual-level correlates do a “pretty good” job of predicting who participates, incorporating social networks deepens our understanding of the factors that lead people to express voice in the democratic process. Even though the participation literature has long been split between scholars who favor a focus on individuals and others who emphasize social networks, the two approaches need not be in tension. Instead, they complement one another. The individualistic factors known to correlate with participation—including education, religious attendance, political knowledge, political conviction, and civic duty—all have a social dimension.},

	abstract = {Volunteering is any activity in which time is given freely to benefit another person, group or cause. Volunteering is part of a cluster of helping behaviors, entailing more commitment than spontaneous assistance but narrower in scope than the care provided to family and friends. Although developed somewhat independently, the study of volunteerism and of social activism have much in common. Since data gathering on volunteering from national samples began about a quarter of a century ago, the rate for the United States has been stable or, according to some studies, rising slightly. Theories that explain volunteering by pointing to individual attributes can be grouped into those that emphasize motives or self-understandings on the one hand and those that emphasize rational action and cost-benefit analysis on the other. Other theories seek to complement this focus on individual level factors by pointing to the role of social resources, specifically social ties and organizational activity, as explanations for volunteering. Support is found for all theories, although many issues remained unresolved. Age, gender and race differences in volunteering can be accounted for, in large part, by pointing to differences in self-understandings, human capital, and social resources. Less attention has been paid to contextual effects on volunteering and, while evidence is mixed, the impact of organizational, community, and regional characteristics on individual decisions to volunteer remains a fruitful field for exploration. Studies of the experience of volunteering have only just begun to plot and explain spells of volunteering over the life course and to examine the causes of volunteer turnover. Examining the premise that volunteering is beneficial for the helper as well as the helped, a number of studies have looked at the impact of volunteering on subjective and objective well-being. Positive effects are found for life-satisfaction, self-esteem, self-rated health, and for educational and occupational achievement, functional ability, and mortality. Studies of youth also suggest that volunteering reduces the likelihood of engaging in problem behaviors such as school truancy and drug abuse.},

	abstract = {Despite a large and growing literature documenting the powerful and positive role that political discussion networks exert on the political behavior among whites, we know little about how political discussion networks affect political behavior among voters of color. To fill this void in the existing literature, we conducted an original survey in California to gather information on a diverse group of registered voters’ political discussion networks and political engagement. The social positioning of ethnoracial groups in society, we contend, will affect how network characteristics explain their levels of political engagement. Our results support this contention. While we find that network characteristics, including network size, partisan homogeneity, and discussion frequency are positively associated with validated voter turnout and nonelectoral political participation, the effects are not uniform across black, Latino, Asian American, and white respondents. This is the first study that examines the relationship between political discussion network characteristics and political engagement among voters of color. Our analysis demonstrates that the opportunities for political integration and engagement offered by political discussion networks are not afforded equally across the U.S. electorate, which has important implications for broader patterns of engagement.},

This volume introduces political theorists and researchers to new theoretical, methodological, and substantive tools for extending political network research into new realms and revitalizing established domains. The authors synthesize new understandings of multimodal political networks, consisting of two or more types of social entities - voters, politicians, parties, events, organizations, nations - and the complex relations between them. They discuss ways to theorize about multimodal connections, methods for measuring and analyzing multimodal datasets, and how the results can reveal new insights into political structures and action. Several empirical applications demonstrate in great detail how multimodal analysts can detect and visualize political communities consisting of diverse social entities.},

This article addresses that research-practice gap by drawing on theories of organizational ecology and findings from a comparative case study of four intermediary organizations that helped with collaborative policy implementation in Oakland, California. I define intermediaries as organizations that operate between policymakers and implementers to affect changes in roles and practices for both parties and show that such organizations typically vary along at least five dimensions. Oakland?s intermediary organizations all provided new implementation resources?knowledge, political/social ties, and an administrative infrastructure?but faced different constraining and enabling conditions. Using insights from this strategic case study, this article begins to build theory about intermediary organizations as important participants in contemporary policy implementation.},

	abstract = {Political participation refers to voluntary activities undertaken by the mass public to inﬂuence public policy, either directly or by affecting the selection of persons who make policies. Examples of these activities include voting in elections, helping a political campaign, donating money to a candidate or cause, contacting ofﬁcials, petitioning, protesting, and working with other people on issues. Particular activities cluster into modes of participation. Substantial cross-national data have shown that wealthier and better-educated people participate at higher rates than the less advantaged, although this relationship is weaker in countries where strong parties or other political organizations provide alternative resources. Research associated with the Civic Voluntarism Model ({CVM}) has documented that people transfer to political activity skills which they acquire in organizations. The {CVM} and other recent studies have also demonstrated that people participate more in response to recruitment or mobilization. (Both terms refer to efforts by one person to increase the activity of another.) The Political Action project has shown that people have expanded their ‘political action repertory’ to encompass both protest and conventional participation. The patterns of participation in authoritarian regimes and in economically less-developed countries raise other issues but substantially follow these broad outlines.},
