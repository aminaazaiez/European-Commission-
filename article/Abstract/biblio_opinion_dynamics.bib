	abstract = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro
and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated
by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale
interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree
of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly
with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this
principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility oppor-
tunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the
cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly,
with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-
defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of
relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social struc-
ture not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

foundations of coordinated activity and consensus in complexly differ-

because social differentiation makes coordination and agreement espe-
cially hard to achieve and maintain. Noah Friedkin examines the process
of social influence and how this process, when it is played out in a
network of interpersonal influence, may result in interpersonal agree-
ments among actors who are located in different parts of a complexly
differentiated organization. This work builds on structural role analysis,
which provides a description of the pattern of social differentiation in a
population. Interpreting the revealed social structures has long been a
problem. Friedkin proposes new steps for structural analysis to deal with
this problem. To explain the coordination of social positions, the author
seeks to develop a structural social psychology that attends to both social
structure and process.},

An analysis of longitudinal data on actors' bases of social power, frequency of interpersonal communications, and interpersonal influences indicates that cohesion, similarity, and centrality have significant effects on issue-related influence net of the elementary power bases. The effects of the structural bases are mediated by the frequency of issue-related communication.

The former would expect social cohesion to be related to stages of socio-economic development. The latter hypothesizes enduring, regionally unique regimes of social cohesion resisting the homogenizing pressures of modernization. The paper finds evidence for both perspectives. On the one hand, a syndrome of social cohesion was identified consisting of trust, equality, order (i.e. lack of crime) and consensus on basic values which correlates closely with indicators of socio-economic development. This finding supports the universalist perspective. On the other hand, and consistent with the particularist perspective, the study found regionally unique patterns for Latin America, Eastern Europe and Scandinavia.},

At the other extreme, community is the most useful level but it is a social construct for which data are difficult to get, given the administrative boundaries used in social surveys. As an initial attempt to measure social cohesion at a subcountry level, this study focuses on census metropolitan areas for which data on several dimensions of social cohesion are available. We use the information gathered by the National Survey on Giving, Volunteering and Participating ({NSGVP}) on three dimensions of social cohesion: political (voting and volunteering), economic (occupation, income, labour force participation) and social (social interactions, informal volunteering). Using statistical techniques including factor analysis and standardization, we create an overall index of social cohesion for each {CMA}.

The size of the required critical mass is expected to vary based on theoretically identifiable features of a social setting.

After discussing the different ways in which nonlinearities can be incorporated in the dynamical model, building on different sociological theories, we explore its mathematical properties and perform simulations to investigate them numerically. After focussing on synthetic hypergraphs, namely on block hypergraphs, we investigate the dynamics on real-world structures, and explore in detail the role of involvement and stubbornness on polarisation.},

In this work, we derive and analyse models for consensus dynamics on hypergraphs, where nodes interact in groups rather than in pairs. Our work reveals that multi-body dynamical eﬀects that go beyond rescaled pairwise interactions can only appear if the interaction function is non-linear, regardless of the underlying multi-body structure. As a practical application, we introduce a speciﬁc non-linear function to model three-body consensus, which incorporates reinforcing group eﬀects such as peer pressure. Unlike consensus processes on networks, we ﬁnd that the resulting dynamics can cause shifts away from the average system state. The nature of these shifts depends on a complex interplay between the distribution of the initial states, the underlying structure and the form of the interaction function. By considering modular hypergraphs, we discover state-dependent, asymmetric dynamics between polarised clusters where multi-body interactions make one cluster dominate the other.},

	abstract = {A fundamental aspect of society is the exchange and discussion of opinions between individuals, occurring in situations as varied as company boardrooms, elementary school classrooms and online social media. After a very brief introduction to the established results of the most fundamental opinion dynamics models, which seek to mathematically capture observed social phenomena, a brief discussion follows on several recent themes pursued by the authors building on the fundamental ideas. In the first theme, we study the way an individual′s self-confidence can develop through contributing to discussions on a sequence of topics, reaching a consensus in each case, where the consensus value to some degree reflects the contribution of that individual to the conclusion. During this process, the individuals in the network and the way they interact can change. The second theme introduces a novel discrete-time model of opinion dynamics to study how discrepancies between an individual′s expressed and private opinions can arise due to stubbornness and a pressure to conform to a social norm. It is also shown that a few extremists can create “pluralistic ignorance”, where people believe there is majority support for a position but in fact the position is privately rejected by the majority. Last, we consider a group of individuals discussing a collection of logically related topics. In particular, we identify that for topics whose logical interdependencies take on a cascade structure, disagreement in opinions can occur if individuals have competing and/or heterogeneous views on how the topics are related, i.e., the logical interdependence structure varies between individuals.},

We study the effects of heterogeneous convergence rate on consensus by investigating the probability of complete consensus, the size of the largest opinion cluster, the number of opinion clusters, and the relaxation time. We find that the decrease of the convergence rate is favorable to decreasing the confidence threshold for the population to always reach complete consensus, and there exists optimal κ resulting in the minimal bounded confidence threshold. Moreover, we find that there exists a window before the threshold of confidence in which complete consensus may be reached with a nonzero probability when κ is not too large. We also find that, within a certain confidence range, decreasing the convergence rate will reduce the relaxation time, which is somewhat counterintuitive.},

While many studies have been devoted to this influence, much less attention has been devoted to the interplay and feedback mechanisms between dynamical processes and network topology on adaptive networks. Adaptive rewiring of links can happen in real life systems such as acquaintance networks where people are more likely to maintain a social connection if their views and values are similar. In our study, we consider different variants of a model for consensus formation. Our investigations reveal that the adaptation of the network topology fosters cluster formation by enhancing communication between agents of similar opinion, though it also promotes the division of these clusters. The temporal behavior is also strongly affected by adaptivity: while, on static networks, it is influenced by percolation properties, on adaptive networks, both the early and late time evolution of the system are determined by the rewiring process. The investigation of a variant of the model reveals that the scenarios of transitions between consensus and polarized states are more robust on adaptive networks.},

Each individual holds an opinion and shares it with others in random pairwise encounters. If the difference in opinions of two interacting agents is less than a given threshold, the discussion will lead to an update of their opinions towards a compromise. If the difference is too large, however, they will ignore each other and separate with their opinions staying unchanged.},

Over the last years, complex networks approach to this problem have yielded important insights and shaped our understanding of scientific communities. In this paper we propose to complement the picture provided by network tools with that coming from using simplicial descriptions of publications and the corresponding topological methods. We show that it is natural to extend the concept of triadic closure to simplicial complexes and show the presence of strong simplicial closure. Focusing on the differences between scientific fields, we find that, while categories are characterized by different collaboration size distributions, the distributions of how many collaborations to which an author is able to participate is conserved across fields pointing to underlying attentional and temporal constraints. We then show that homological cycles, that can intuitively be thought as hole in the network fabric, are an important part of the underlying community linking structure.},

	abstract = {Two species compete for territory along their mutual boundary. The species are fairly matched and the result of conflict is the invasion by one of the species of territory held by the other. A simple stochastic model for this process is described and rules are given for the calculation, as a function of time, of the probabilities that individual territories and groups of territories are held by a single species. Asymptotic results are given for the pattern of territories held by a single species, and here a remarkable distinction is seen between the cases of one-dimensional and two-dimensional competition and the case of three-dimensional competition. The process of invasion is contrasted with two relatively benign processes, that in which an exchange of territories is arranged and that in which a spatial alternation of species may be beneficial to the community. The implications of the long-term behaviour of such processes are discussed. It is suggested further that, under certain ideal conditions, it may be possible to estimate the duration of a spatial struggle for life by observing at some time the configuration of territories held by each species.},

	abstract = {A fundamental aspect of society is the exchange and discussion of opinions between individuals, occurring in situations as varied as company boardrooms, elementary school classrooms and online social media. After a very brief introduction to the established results of the most fundamental opinion dynamics models, which seek to mathematically capture observed social phenomena, a brief discussion follows on several recent themes pursued by the authors building on the fundamental ideas. In the first theme, we study the way an individual′s self-confidence can develop through contributing to discussions on a sequence of topics, reaching a consensus in each case, where the consensus value to some degree reflects the contribution of that individual to the conclusion. During this process, the individuals in the network and the way they interact can change. The second theme introduces a novel discrete-time model of opinion dynamics to study how discrepancies between an individual′s expressed and private opinions can arise due to stubbornness and a pressure to conform to a social norm. It is also shown that a few extremists can create “pluralistic ignorance”, where people believe there is majority support for a position but in fact the position is privately rejected by the majority. Last, we consider a group of individuals discussing a collection of logically related topics. In particular, we identify that for topics whose logical interdependencies take on a cascade structure, disagreement in opinions can occur if individuals have competing and/or heterogeneous views on how the topics are related, i.e., the logical interdependence structure varies between individuals.},

A popular hypothesis states that networks with many clustered ties and a high degree of separation will be less effective for behavioral diffusion than networks in which locally redundant ties are rewired to provide shortcuts across the social space. A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. The behavior spread farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks.},

Although these mechanisms have been identiﬁed by quantitative theories, their role and relative importance are not entirely understood, since empirical veriﬁcation has so far been hindered by the lack of appropriate data. Here we analyse a dataset recording the spreading dynamics of the world’s largest Voice over Internet Protocol service to empirically support the assumptions behind models of social contagion. We show that the rate of spontaneous service adoption is constant, the probability of adoption via social inﬂuence is linearly proportional to the fraction of adopting neighbours, and the rate of service termination is time-invariant and independent of the behaviour of peers. By implementing the detected diﬀusion mechanisms into a dynamical agent-based model, we are able to emulate the adoption dynamics of the service in several countries worldwide. This approach enables us to make medium-term predictions of service adoption and disclose dependencies between the dynamics of innovation spreading and the socioeconomic development of a country.},

This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.},

In the 1950s, critics of this definition noted that different cohesion measures often failed to intercorrelate. By the mid-1960s, A. J. Lott and B. E. Lott (1965) conceptualized cohesion as interpersonal attraction because researchers mainly focused on this "force." Multidimensional models of cohesion predominated in the 1980s and 1990s, the debate now focused on defining those dimensions. In addition to A. V. Carron's (1988) hierarchical model, several bidimensional models are summarized, including task and social cohesion, vertical and horizontal cohesion, belongingness and morale, and personal versus social attraction. Cohesion will continue to be a vital construct in research on groups and organizations into the 21st century, with important challenges to be addressed.

While many studies have been devoted to this influence, much less attention has been devoted to the interplay and feedback mechanisms between dynamical processes and network topology on adaptive networks. Adaptive rewiring of links can happen in real life systems such as acquaintance networks where people are more likely to maintain a social connection if their views and values are similar. In our study, we consider different variants of a model for consensus formation. Our investigations reveal that the adaptation of the network topology fosters cluster formation by enhancing communication between agents of similar opinion, though it also promotes the division of these clusters. The temporal behavior is also strongly affected by adaptivity: while, on static networks, it is influenced by percolation properties, on adaptive networks, both the early and late time evolution of the system are determined by the rewiring process. The investigation of a variant of the model reveals that the scenarios of transitions between consensus and polarized states are more robust on adaptive networks.},

This shift provides new challenges for social scientists and other non-profit researchers who seek to analyze public posts with a purpose of better understanding human interaction and improving the human condition. This paper seeks to outline some of the recent changes in social media data analysis, with a focus on Twitter, specifically. Using Twitter data from a 24-hour period following The Sisters in Spirit Candlelight Vigil, sponsored by the Native Women’s Association of Canada, this article compares three free-use Twitter application programming interfaces for capturing tweets and enabling analysis. Although recent Twitter data restrictions limit free access to tweets, there are many dynamic options for social scientists to choose from in the capture and analysis of Twitter and other social media platform data. This paper calls for critical social media data analytics combined with traditional, qualitative methods to address the developing ‘data gold rush.’},

	abstract = {Members in a social group may change over time: a new member is recruited; a current member stops his or her position; a candidate supersedes a member of the group. Here we investigate the eects of changes of nodes on the dynamics of opinion formation. In our model, opinion formation is in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, a network evolves through a voting process that is used to select agents to add into the network, to remove from the network or to be replaced by other agents. Special rules for the voting process are necessary in the ﬁrst stage. We focus on two rules, namely, majority rule and random rule. In the second stage, opinion formation takes place. We ﬁnd that the majority rule generally foster consensus formation in comparison to the random rule. We also investigate the eects of changes of agents on two-party systems, in which there are two parties and opinions of members in the same party are close to each other. In particular, the eects of diversity of opinions for two-party systems are studied. A counterintuitive ﬁnding is that the diversity of opinions, instead of hindering consensus formation, facilitates consensus formation.},

At each time step, a randomly selected node updates its state ("opinion") according to the majority opinion of the nodes that it is linked to; subsequently, all links are reassigned with probability p̃ (q̃) if they connect nodes with equal (opposite) opinions. In contrast to earlier work, we ensure that the average connectivity ("degree") of each node is independent of the system size ("intensive"), by choosing p̃ and q̃ to be of O(1/N). Using simulations and analytic arguments, we determine the final steady states and the relaxation into these states for different system sizes. We find two absorbing states, characterized by perfect consensus, and one metastable state, characterized by a population split evenly between the two opinions. The relaxation time of this state grows exponentially with the number of nodes, N. A second metastable state, found in the earlier studies, is no longer observed.},

From a linear algebra point of view, this involves deﬁning and evaluating functions of the associated adjacency matrix. Recent work indicates that there are further beneﬁts from accounting directly for higher order interactions, notably through a hypergraph representation where an edge may involve multiple nodes. Building on these ideas, we motivate, deﬁne and analyze a class of spectral centrality measures for identifying important nodes and hyperedges in hypergraphs, generalizing existing network science concepts. By exploiting the latest developments in nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, we show how the resulting constrained nonlinear eigenvalue problems have unique solutions that can be computed efﬁciently via a nonlinear power method iteration. We illustrate the measures on realistic data sets.},

	abstract = {Cell-to-cell communication is mainly triggered by ligand-receptor activities. Through ligandreceptor pairs, cells coordinate complex processes such as development, homeostasis, and immune response. In this work, we model the ligand-receptor-mediated cell-to-cell communication network as a weighted directed hypergraph. In this mathematical model, collaborating cell types are considered as a node community while the ligand-receptor pairs connecting them are considered a hyperedge community. We first define the community structures in a weighted directed hypergraph and develop an exact community detection method to identify these communities. We then modify approximate community detection algorithms designed for simple graphs to identify the nodes and hyperedges within each community. Application to synthetic hypergraphs with known community structure confirmed that one of the proposed approximate community identification strategies, named {HyperCommunity} algorithm, can effectively and precisely detect embedded communities. We then applied this strategy to two organism-wide datasets and identified putative community structures. Notably the method identifies non-overlapping edge-communities mediated by different sets of ligand-receptor pairs, however node-communities can overlap.},

In order to better depict the growth mechanism and competitive aspect of real hypernetworks, we propose a model in term of the non-uniform growth. Besides hyperdegrees, the other two important factors are introduced to underlie preferential attachment. One dimension is the brand effect and the other is the competitiveness. Our model can accurately describe the evolution of real hypernetworks. The paper analyzes the model and calculates the stationary average hyperdegree distribution of the hypernetwork by using Poisson process theory and a continuous technique. We also address the limit in which this model has a condensation. The theoretical analyses agree with numerical simulations. Our model is universal, in that the standard preferential attachment, the fitness model in complex networks and scale-free model in hypernetworks can all be seen as degenerate cases of the model.},

	abstract = {Social influence is the process by which individuals adapt their opinion, revise their beliefs, or change their behavior as a result of social interactions with other people. In our strongly interconnected society, social influence plays a prominent role in many self-organized phenomena such as herding in cultural markets, the spread of ideas and innovations, and the amplification of fears during epidemics. Yet, the mechanisms of opinion formation remain poorly understood, and existing physics-based models lack systematic empirical validation. Here, we report two controlled experiments showing how participants answering factual questions revise their initial judgments after being exposed to the opinion and confidence level of others. Based on the observation of 59 experimental subjects exposed to peer-opinion for 15 different items, we draw an influence map that describes the strength of peer influence during interactions. A simple process model derived from our observations demonstrates how opinions in a group of interacting people can converge or split over repeated interactions. In particular, we identify two major attractors of opinion: (i) the expert effect, induced by the presence of a highly confident individual in the group, and (ii) the majority effect, caused by the presence of a critical mass of laypeople sharing similar opinions. Additional simulations reveal the existence of a tipping point at which one attractor will dominate over the other, driving collective opinion in a given direction. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of public opinion formation and managing conflicting situations in which self-confident and better informed minorities challenge the views of a large uninformed majority.},

These models are maximum-entropy ensembles under the constraints that the expected values of a set of graph observables are equal to given values. Here we extend these maximum-entropy ensembles to random simplicial complexes, which are more adequate and versatile constructions to model complex systems in many applications. We show that many random simplicial complex models considered in the literature can be casted as maximum-entropy ensembles under certain constraints. We introduce and analyze the most general random simplicial complex ensemble \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}Delta\}\$ with statistically independent simplices. Our analysis is simplified by the observation that any distribution \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}(O)\$ on any collection of objects \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}={\textbackslash}\{O{\textbackslash}\}\$, including graphs and simplicial complexes, is maximum-entropy under the constraint that the expected value of \$-{\textbackslash}ln {\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}(O)\$ is equal to the entropy of the distribution. With the help of this observation, we prove that ensemble \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}Delta\}\$ is maximum-entropy under two types of constraints that fix the expected numbers of simplices and their boundaries.},

This combination of meeting processes results in a spectrum of features exhibited by large social networks, including the presence of more high- and low-degree nodes than when links are formed independently at random, having low distances between nodes in the network, and having high clustering of links on a local level. We fit the model to data from six networks and impute the relative ratio of random to network-based meetings in link formation, which turns out to vary dramatically across applications. We show that as the random/network-based meeting ratio varies, the resulting degree distributions can be ordered in the sense of stochastic dominance, which allows us to infer how the formation process affects average utility in the network.

	abstract = {We study a tractable opinion dynamics model that generates long-run disagreements and persistent opinion fluctuations. Our model involves an inhomogeneous stochastic gossip process of continuous opinion dynamics in a society consisting of two types of agents: (1) regular agents who update their beliefs according to information that they receive from their social neighbors and (2) stubborn agents who never update their opinions and might represent leaders, political parties, or media sources attempting to influence the beliefs in the rest of the society. When the society contains stubborn agents with different opinions, the belief dynamics never lead to a consensus (among the regular agents). Instead, beliefs in the society fail to converge almost surely, the belief profile keeps on fluctuating in an ergodic fashion, and it converges in law to a nondegenerate random vector. The structure of the graph describing the social network and the location of the stubborn agents within it shape the opinion dynamics. The expected belief vector is proved to evolve according to an ordinary differential equation coinciding with the Kolmogorov backward equation of a continuous-time Markov chain on the graph with absorbing states corresponding to the stubborn agents, and hence to converge to a harmonic vector, with every regular agent's value being the weighted average of its neighbors' values, and boundary conditions corresponding to the stubborn agents' beliefs. Expected cross products of the agents' beliefs allow for a similar characterization in terms of coupled Markov chains on the graph describing the social network. We prove that, in large-scale societies, which are highly fluid, meaning that the product of the mixing time of the Markov chain on the graph describing the social network and the relative size of the linkages to stubborn agents vanishes as the population size grows large, a condition of homogeneous influence emerges, whereby the stationary beliefs' marginal distributions of most of the regular agents have approximately equal first and second moments.},

              who influence others but do not change their opinions. We focus on a generalization of the classical voter model by introducing nodes (stubborn agents) that have a fixed state. We show that the presence of stubborn agents with opposing opinions precludes convergence to consensus; instead, opinions converge in distribution with disagreement and fluctuations. In addition to the first moment of this distribution typically studied in the literature, we study the behavior of the second moment in terms of network properties and the opinions and locations of stubborn agents. We also study the problem of optimal placement of stubborn agents where the location of a fixed number of stubborn agents is chosen to have the maximum impact on the long-run expected opinions of agents.},
