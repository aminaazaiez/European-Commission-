The Commission services have clearly marked the fertilizer industry as the industry most exposed to carbon leakage. 2/2.	Climate change mitigation in agriculture and the contribution of the fertilizer sector, Fertilizers are an important part of GHG calculations in agriculture. Intensification means that more CO2 will be taken up by the plants. Using the right fertilizer and the right techniques can lower emissions.
